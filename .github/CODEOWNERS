# CODEOWNERS
# This file defines code ownership for automatic review requests.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners (@username or @org/team-name).
# When a pull request changes matching files, the listed owners are automatically requested for review.
#
# Documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# Order matters! Later matches take precedence over earlier ones.
# Use '#' for comments. Patterns follow .gitignore rules.
