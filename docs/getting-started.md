# Getting started with DMMapp

Welcome to DMMapp, your gateway to discovering digitized medieval manuscript collections worldwide. This guide shows you how to find the libraries you need.

## What you'll do

- Browse libraries from around the world
- Search for specific collections by location
- Filter for high-quality image resources

## Browse the directory

When you open the dashboard, you'll see a list of libraries with digitized manuscript collections.

### View the list

Scroll through the directory to explore libraries. Each entry shows:

- Library name
- Location (city and country)
- Link to the digitized collection
- Available features (like IIIF support)

### Read library details

Click any library name to visit their collection website. You'll find manuscripts, catalogs, and research tools.

!!! tip "Explore nearby collections"
    Libraries in the same city often share similar manuscript types. If one library has what you need, check others in that area.

## Search and filter

Find specific libraries quickly using the search and filter tools.

### Search by location

Type a city or country name in the search box. The list updates instantly to show matching libraries.

**Examples:**

- Type "Paris" to see French collections in Paris
- Type "Italy" to see all Italian libraries
- Type "Oxford" to find Oxford collections

The search looks at both city and country names, so you'll see all relevant results.

### Filter by nation

Use the nation filter to view libraries from a specific country:

1. Click the **Nation** dropdown
2. Select a country from the list
3. The directory shows only libraries from that nation

Select **All Nations** to view the complete directory again.

!!! tip "Combine search and filter"
    Use both tools together. Filter by nation, then search for a city. This helps when multiple countries have cities with the same name.

## Find IIIF resources

Some libraries offer IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) support. This means you can view high-quality images that work across different tools and platforms.

### What IIIF gives you

Libraries with IIIF support let you:

- Zoom into manuscript details with high resolution
- Compare images from different libraries side-by-side
- Use images in research tools and annotation software
- Download images in various formats

### Use the IIIF toggle

Turn on **IIIF Only** to see libraries that support this standard:

1. Find the **IIIF Only** toggle at the top of the directory
2. Click to turn it on
3. The list shows only IIIF-enabled libraries

Turn it off to see all libraries again.

!!! info "About IIIF"
    IIIF is a global standard that makes digitized images more useful for research. Not all libraries support it yet, but the number grows each year.

## Tips for your research

- **Start broad, then narrow**: Browse all libraries first, then use filters to focus on specific regions
- **Check multiple libraries**: Different libraries may have different manuscripts from the same region or period
- **Bookmark collections**: Save library websites you use frequently for quick access
- **Verify availability**: Some collections may have limited access or require registration
